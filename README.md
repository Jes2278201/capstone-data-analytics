# How the August Complex Fire affected the California Housing Market
This repository holds the files about my dive into understanding how the August Complex fire from August to November 2020 affected the housing market<br />
The Data Visualization folder holds my PBIX file used to create my visualization in Power BI<br />
The Datasets folder holds the xlsx file I used to create the visualizations and includes the original data, the modified format for the data, and whether the county was or wasn't affected by the fire<br />
The Documentation folder holds the docx file that records my progress, hypotheses, and conclusion to this project<br />

# How to replicate
Take the dataset and import it into Power BI<br />
Select only the modified data format sheet as it contains all the data needed<br />
Create a line graph and select the month-year, region, and prices columns<br />
The graph will show the housing market changes in each county across 2022<br />
Select a slicer and assign it the "affected by fire" column to view the counties affected or not affected by the fire<br />
Create another slicer and assign it the region column so you may choose which county you'd like a better look into<br />
